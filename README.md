# hyprland-dask-to-dock

Implementation of Gnome's [Dash to Dock](https://github.com/micheleg/dash-to-dock) extension for the [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) Wayland window compositor.
This lets you hide and reveal applications by sending them to one-off ephemeral "special" workspaces. Window rules are supported.
